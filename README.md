# Overview

I'm experimenting with computer graphics to get a feel for how rendering
pipelines work and have some understanding of GPU / GPGPUs. Mainly rendering /
memory access / related stuff. Firstly I chose Raylib but I decided against it.
It was doing too much for me. I chose Sokol because of @yacineMTB, and the
simplicy of it. All the code is geared towards Apple Silicon.
